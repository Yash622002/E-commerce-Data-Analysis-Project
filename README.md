E-commerce Data Analysis

This project explores an E-commerce dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and MySQL to gain insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends. 
The analysis covers customer distribution across cities and states, yearly and monthly order patterns, revenue contribution by product categories, seller rankings, and customer retention metrics.
Key findings include over 45K orders placed in 2017, with the Bed, Bath & Table category contributing ~10.7% of total revenue, and almost 99.9% of orders being paid in installments.
The sales showed a ~20% year-over-year growth between 2017 and 2018, while customer retention within six months was extremely low, highlighting opportunities for loyalty programs. 
This project demonstrates the integration of data preprocessing, SQL-based querying, and visualization to deliver meaningful business insights.
